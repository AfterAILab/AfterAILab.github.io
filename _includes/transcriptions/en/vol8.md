# I Bought a Notebook and a Printer

*2025-07-25*

I have known the TRAVELER'S notebook brand for a couple of years but have not owned one because its regular size notebooks are too big to my taste: I usually use A7 notebooks. Some days ago, when I was looking around at a stationary store, I found a passport-size model and bought it without hesitation. I really like its simple leather case. Although the cover sometimes interferes with my pocket, hoping I will get used to it or will find a solution, I will continue using it for awhile.

Another thing I bought is a portable sticker printer, iNSPiC by Canon. What do you think about the picture attached to this newsletter? It was printed with my iNSPiC. Although the printing quality leaves something to be desired, the best part of the portable printer is that it does not need ink cartridges; the sticker paper is called Zink, meaning Zero Ink, so all the coloring materials reside in the blank stickers. I think iNSPiC perfectly fits my use case; I take a photo and will immediately print it and attach to my notebooks.

# I will hold a booth at Maker Faire Bay Area 2025!

I'm planning an interactive exhibit where people of all ages will enjoy writing something with pen and paper. Please refer to the flyer for details!
