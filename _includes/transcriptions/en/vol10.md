I Want to Live in Tsunashima

These days, I have been going to a coworking space called SHARE LOUNGE in Tsunashima, Yokohama City, which is a few stations away from my town. Through walking around the town, I have discovered many good things: many good restaurants on the west of the station, many cafes as well as the coworking space on the east, and the best thing is the long stretch of the embankment path along Tsurumi River. The river is wide and calm, it has greens on both sides, and there are only low to middle residential buildings, which let us walk without unnecessary distractions. Now, I want a house somewhere close to good embankment paths like Tsunashima.

When Programmers become Redundant

AI agents are taking basic programming tasks away from programmers. Supposing a future where AI agents can make any apps, I do not think I will be writing code like now. Of course, the fun element of programming will remain untouched. However, the pretext that boosts the joy of programming by 10 times will certainly disappear; it is the belief that it is only myself who can solve this problem effectively. If AI breaks the situation and belief, I will probably lose interest and stop writing code.

I would like to do something that I can believe only I can manage to do as my occupation. Unlike human chess players, I think it is really difficult for programmers to earn money from fans by showcasing their programming skills live on YouTube; programming is not designed for that. When programmers become redundant, I would like to change my profession to something that I can express myself and have a chance to earn fans. It might be a writer, sushi chef, or something.
