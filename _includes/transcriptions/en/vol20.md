We Bought Our First Car

Since my wife got pregnant, we had been discussing the idea of
getting a family car. Fast forward eight months, we've finally purchased
our first car!* We used to subscribe to a car sharing service, but
having our own car freed us up on a totally different level.

For the first a few days since I signed the contract,
mysterious excitement would wake me up in the middle
of night. It is true that the car is the biggest purchase
in our lives, however I couldn't quite understand the
mechanism about why trading money for a good aroused me this much.
Isn't it just a transformation of abstract wealth into a concrete form of wealth?

Probably, it is because we were gambling;
betting big on the future with a car and less
money. The paperwork was really tough and
we would lose money even if we sold the car
without using it, so there was no way back. Thus,
the excitement seems to have come from
the gambling nature of the purchase rather than
the joy of owning a car or the bright prospect that the car was expected
to bring about.

It has not passed the one week mark, but my wife and I have gone
out for a drive every day. The car has opened up the doors of
restaurants and shops that are far from train stations for us.
Exploring new places has surely enriched our quality of lives.

These days, I've been able to sleep well. I'm looking forward to driving
with my wife and our future baby.

*“Our car” is similar to “Our school.” On paper, the official owner of the car is the loan lender until we fully pay it off.
