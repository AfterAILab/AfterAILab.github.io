Run the Long Path

Recently, I've been onerously working on performance improvement of a web
application at work. At first, in order to deliver the result to the
customers quickly, I hacked the way around. However, it was not
as effective as I wished, so we decided to take a long-term approach
and run through the task marathon as fast as possible. Now, although
the path to the goal is longer than at first, each step is well-defined
and leads to clearer codebase. This episode taught me a lesson:
take the long-but-steady path and reserve the shortcut for emergency.

words. It's under
active development
and you are welcomed
to try it out:
