AfterAI Weekly Vol. 11 2025-08-13



It is mid-August. I might be wrong but I am feeling the season is transitioning from summer to fall. Sensing the end of summer, I felt like running around the area. So, I bought a pair of running shoes.



I ran to the river-side area of the Tama River, where I have not been to since I moved here because it is 15 minutes away from where I live by walk. Usually, I do not go further than 10 minutes by foot. Running opened up new worlds for me. I took the left picture from an ally that leads to the Tama. I like beautiful sceneries as everyone does, but my favorites are this kind of narrow paths that make me feel as if I were in an adventure.



I came home after running for an hour and a half. While running, I was enjoying my memory of jogging in the fields around my parents' house when I was a university student.



Exerpts from my Notebook



It might develop a richer society if we set an upper limit for our income. In that society, you cannot earn more money than the limit no matter how much you work. I hope people will care more about what is important to them rather than chasing money.



I found some families at my coworking space because the schools are closed for a summer break. I wondered those kids think about the adults there; some adults were watching YouTube with their phone while ostensibly working on a computer.



I will ask visitors to my booth at the upcoming Maker Faire Bay Area to write their own personal news on a card with a pen. I have just realized that this activity resembles what people do at Japanese shrines. There, people write their wishes on a horse-shaped wooden board and hang them together.



It is becoming a farce to ask questions to a human being.



One of the reasons why I started liking English is that I could read a lot of interesting essays in the process of studying English for the university entrance exam.
