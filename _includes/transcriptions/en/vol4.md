Hello! How are you doing?
Some days ago, It occurred to me that
maybe today (June 21) was the summer solstice.
I asked Alexa about its date, and boom!
it was a bingo!

I sorted out clothes in our closet with my wife.
This time, we threw away bags of old clothes,
which are still wearable but we hadn't worn for
multiple years. I used to keep everything unless they were broken. I guess
it should be taught in middle school because it is a useful life skill.

I also bought a pair of aluminium
table and chair for our balcony.
Nothing beats the chill out time on the
chair at night, especially after
a hot bath. For me, it is the best
digital detox method. Recommended
for those who want to make better use of
their balcony.

Have you noticed that the letter
color changed to black? It was
blue until last week's publication.
After a long mileage of 3
newspapers and uncountable number
of memo, the blue pen, uni-ball
Zento went out of ink. Thank you
zento, I enjoyed the journey with you.
Now, I'm writing this newspaper
with a uni-ball one.

On last Sunday, I went to a
local library. There, I found many
people, young and old, were studying
at the desks. I walked around the
floors but there was no vacant desk.
I'm impressed to have this many people
studying very hard for their futures
in my neighborhood. They were
shining more than anything at 10am
on a Sunday morning.
