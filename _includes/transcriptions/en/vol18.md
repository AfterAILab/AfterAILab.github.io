Before the Event

WAYMO surprised
me with its delicate
handling in the
narrow space between
a parked car and
the oncoming
traffic.

Scanning AfterAI
Weekly vol.17 at
San Francisco Main
Library was an
exciting experience.

During the
Event

Until the show
started, I'd been
worried about a
sad scenario where
nobody had come.
I'm glad that many
people stopped by at
my booth, reading
others' cards and
writing their own.
Some folks, passionately
thanked me for having
this booth sympathetically
with my intention.

After the
Event

Enjoyed talking
with Chris about
the future society.
Bought two key chains
from Renee: a cute
little chick and a
funny quote. Bought
a knit cap that features
a dumb pigeon on the
front side. Benjie,
who had come to my
booth and resonated
with my message
vigorously the day before,
saw me off with his wife at SFO. They even gave me a baby carrier for our expected baby.
