Notes from my Notebook, nearly unedited

When I go back to my parents' home, I feel relaxed. That state
of mind is far from the compulsive mode of mind. As a
programmer whose existence is threatened by AI.
I'm almost always driven by a sense of urgency.
My thoughts are constantly occupied by things like chasing
tech news and listening to "educational" podcasts.
It feels like being a busy mother pushing her kid
hard to make it to a nursery school, 24 hours.

Now, I'm writing this page
in my bathroom after washing
the bath. Pressing the notebook
against the wall of the bathroom,
I'm thinking, "This is a new experience.
Phones don't get scratched. This
notebook, on the other hand, gets
worn out, and that's what gives
it character and makes it lovable.
Phones are boring. They all have
the latest OS. They are the
least necessary tool for adventure.

Looking at this
black, rectangular
phone, I wonder,
"What is this thing?"

That all you need is your phone
means that you don't make connections
with other things, moreover, you'll
never feel attachment to your phone.
Our society is abundant in
materials, however, our perceptions
tell the opposite. We lack the
connections and attachments to
the things around us. Recall
the feeling of using up the ink
of your favorite pen, it gives you
a satisfactory memory and a chance
to explore the world, I mean, shops.
These days I think it's best to just
treat smartphones as "convenient
tools" and refrain from using it
for addictive, entertainment purposes.
