## Back in Sendai After Years Away

On Monday, my wife suddenly got a business trip request to the north east part of Japan. Thinking that it's a good chance to revisit Sendai city for the first time in years, I decided to go along with her. It was a bit worrying to find three of the major shopping malls had been closed for a few years, however, some of my favorite restaurants and caf√©s were doing just as well as when I used to live there. It stings when I find my used-to-go places closed, but I even cherish the pain because it is the sign of my attachment to the city.

## F1, the Movie

(Drawing of an F1 car goes here) Boooooom!

I watched the Apple Original movie, F1. It was my first time to try an IMAX theater, and I liked it. The superior sound system was worth a few extra dollars: I could enjoy the roar of F1 cars as if I was sitting behind the steering wheel. Although the story follows the Hollywood method, I was walking out of the theater wanting to make my life as exciting as the movie after the show.

This was not my first time to watch a movie featuring races, and I'm empathizing with the creators because the theme innately makes the screen monotonic as all the races share the same goal, run faster than anybody else. Anyway, I recommend F1 the movie, and I hope you will like it.
