I Need Time to Digest Good News

I've received a good news this week.
My booth neighbor at Maker Faire Bay Area
2025 Christine sent me an email
containing an image of her handwritten
newsletter entry for AfterAI Weekly.
I was so happy about it that I closed the mail app after reading
the first sentence on impulse. It's the following day that I could finally
read the whole email and reply.

Hello!

Mr.Happy Email         hi
                       Me

This is not the first time that I've needed a break before
enjoying the entirety of the good news. The typical examples are
when I received an email from an event organizer with subject
"Application Approved", and when an old friend texted me out of the blue.
I think I flinch at unexpected possibilities that someone opens up for me
even though I'm really thankful to that person. It's human nature, please
forgive me.

Long Sleeves

The temperature in my city has
suddenly dropped from 30°C
to 10°C. Even though
I prefer a T-shirt and
shorts for running,
these days I need a
hoodie and sweat
pants to go out in
the first place.

Ive Trimmed Beard

9mm       9mm
   12mm

Upon my wife's request,
I've trimmed and
decluttered my
beard and mustache.
I had grown them
so that I'd shape them from the
full volume like a sculpture. However,
the climax seemed too far away. So,
I'm happy with the current neat styling.
