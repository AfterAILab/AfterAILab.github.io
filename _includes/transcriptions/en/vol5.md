# AfterAI Weekly

Japan Open-Air Folk House Museum

My wife and I visited the folk house museum
last weekend. Its houses and environment were
surely awesome, but the unexpected gem was the
volunteer people who were enjoyably maintaining the
houses and giving short tours.

## It's a Time Machine to the Pre-Smartphone Era

The volunteers were making fire
at an irori, a traditional Japanese
fireplace, inside one of the folkhouses.
The soot produced by the irori
kills the bugs in the thatched roof
and coats the wooden beams.

I strongly feel the distances among people
widened due to smartphones. I highly recommend
this place for those who share the same sentiment
as mine. While my wife and I were there, kind
volunteers invited us to sit down and chat
with them surrounding the house's Irori, a Japanese
traditional fireplace. After a lovely chat, we joined
a 30-minutes folk house tour. It was a good educational
session, but the best part was that the guide person
was so nice that he showed us around for 60 minutes.
I felt as if I had been transported 20 years into the past.

We found a basket in one of
the folk houses. The guide
told me people used to use
it to cross a valley by hanging
it to the rope.

## Ownership is not Necessary to feel Connected

I asked the guide about good things that he enjoys as a volunteer there.
His answer was that he could enjoy the houses as if they had been
his country houses. I used to dream of buying an old Japanese folk house, but
I knew it's an unattainable dream because the maintenance costs a fortune.
His words helped me see a new possibility; by serving as a volunteer in the future,
I will be able to feel connected not only the wonderful houses but the likeminded people.
