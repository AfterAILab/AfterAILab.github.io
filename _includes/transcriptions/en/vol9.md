Company Website Renewal!

We have redesigned our company website and released today. Our website had been hosted by Obsidian Publish for about a year but we were not satisfied with the system and its pricing. So, we moved to GitHub Pages as its push-and-deploy workflow fits better to the hands of a programmer, me, myself. Moreover, it does not cost a cent.



I've vibe-coded the website and I was surprised by the quality of the work. I think it looks better than the average website created from a template; most of my websites were made from templates. I think I will just talk to an AI agent first when I need a website next time.

TRAVELER'S notebook - Round 2

Last week, I bought a TRAVELER'S notebook because the leather cover looked so cool. After using it for a week, I decided to remove the leather cover. It was too inconvenient for my use case, which involves frequent putting in and taking out from my pants pocket. It hurts storing the cover in my closet....... However, the 12-color pencil set from TRAVELER'S FACTORY is good. It only cost $3.

Fixing an insole

Since last month, my left shoe had had its insole shift inside of it to the extent that the insole was jumping out of the shoe. Although I did not expect much, I tried to fix it with an instant glue, and it worked! It's good to try before giving up.

Healthier drinking: Beer to Shochu

Last week, my doctor told me that my uric acidity was higher than the healthy range, and it might trouble me with gout if I would not take any measures. Since then, I switched beer to shochu when I drink at home although I like beer more. These days, I have been waiting for the day when I start enjoying shochu's unique taste.
