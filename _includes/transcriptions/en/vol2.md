Adults keep themselves busy to
run away from so-called void anxiety.
They work hard, do extra house keeping,
study random stuff because of this anxiety.
It's okay to confront it, however, you should
know that the battle is almost hopeless.

Cheer up!
Otherwise
You'll feel
yourself
down, down, down

People often refer to Maslow's
hierarchy of needs to explain how
humans behave. I suggest another
layer at the third level to refine it,
which is "Exile from void anxiety
that arises from boredom."

Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs:

Self-actualization
Esteem
Love & belonging (Escape from void anxiety)
Safety needs
Physical needs
I sometimes go to the theatre. I'm
horrified when it gets dark. I hope
many people share the fear of
"Oh, I cannot leave the seat for 2
hours. What if the movie sucks
or I want to go to the restroom?"

A1 A2 A3 ... An
Each seat has drink holders
on both sides. In most cases
you can use one on whichever side.
It's when people with opposite
preference occupy your right
and left, that you start your
life as the protagonist of your own
movie.

I found a local cafe in my neighborhood. I like the gentle
steam rising from big silver kettles. The orange lighting
enriches the atmosphere. The coffee tastes the best when the
cool air from the air conditioning and one from the entrance door mixes
naturally. I love the kind staff, too.
