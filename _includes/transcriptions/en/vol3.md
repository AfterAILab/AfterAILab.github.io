I caught a cold. Although I had to sleep all day for the first few days,
it's becoming better now. There is a Japanese saying that goes like
“Illness comes from mind.” I'm sure that I fell ill because of this
serious problem, “How to live better in the world after AI.” As news media
reports, entry level positions are taken over by AI, and people at middle to
senior levels have to adapt and incorporate AI into their workflows, otherwise
those who don't will be top candidates of severance. As a programmer,
I have been exposed to this immense pressure to the extent that I got sick.

In the evening of the third day after I got sick, I was randomly watching
YouTube and stumbled upon one video, in which Jun Miura was answering a
question, “Work is boring. What to do?” His answer was “You guys blindly
assume your current profession is your life's work, right? It is actually
a side job. Your life's work is eating and pooping.” This line reminded me
of an important fact that everything other than work will not suffer
from the disrupting/disturbing AI tsunami. As an example, when I eat
good pizza and pasta, I feel so happy that I fly in the sky in my mind.
I'm sure this happiness continues to be beside me no matter how largely
AI changes the world. 🍴🙂🖋️

Until recently, “Find your strengths and nurture them.” has been the goal of
education. However, recently “Acquire the flexibility to adapt to whatever
change AI will bring about” seems to have taken over the place. Although
I think it has no hope in humanity to try molding people as slimes to fill
in whatever gaps AI will leave for a time frame, I guess we have to
adapt to survive.

To sum it up, here are the things I currently think necessary to live a better life
in the world after AI. 1. Be flexible for the time when societal changes
deprive you of work and you have to feed yourself and your family. 2. Don't cling
onto your current work because it is your side job (you know what I mean if you
have read this article.) 3. Find what you like outside of your work and cherish them
more than you do with your work.
