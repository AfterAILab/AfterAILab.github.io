Reading is Loving

At my booth, "Let's Write and Share
News Cards!", many people wrote and shared
various stories. Through the experience of running the booth for 3 days,
I noticed that people became happy when I read aloud their cards and
engaged in a chat with them. They joyfully shared more details so that I could
vicariously enjoy one page of their unique lives.

Taking time to ruminate on one's intimate news, carefully writing it down
on a piece of card, and somebody else attentively reads it and sympathizes
- that's when your life is requited. By listening to their stories, I was also
feeling happy because they opened up and
let me in. I must say our communication
was suffused with love.

I re-learned the nature of love through
this exhibit. That is: love doesn't need money
but is priceless, and love is contagious. Although
the whole trip cost a lot and the flights
were less than comfortable, I gained more.
I'm glad if my booth rekindled the joy of
handwriting in visitors' daily lives because
that is what I believe people need in the world
after AI.

< My wife and I will have a baby in December.
I wonder what it is like to watch my kid write a card.

After the Trip

It's always sad to get back to the
daily routines after a trip, but a bowl of
tasty ramen lifts me up and keeps me going.

Father, warmly,
watching his daughter
Write her card.
