AfterAI Weekly
Golden Era to Read Foreign Books
I recently started reading, "Bullshit Jobs" by David Graeber. As
an ESL learner, I have tried reading many English books. However,
I could successfully read cover-to-cover only a few of them, and
honestly, none of them were perfectly clear to me.

Despite the formidable challenge, thanks to AI, I have been able to
comprehend every sentence. Whenever
I had a difficulty in understanding the
structure of a long sentence, I'd take
a picture of the page and asked the AI;
then it'd give me a tailor-made explanation as if it were from
an English class of high school. With its help, I am sure I can make it this time.

Your pictures
have enough
contexts so that
I can teach you
precisely what
each sentence
means.

EVANGELION
I've completed watching "Neon Genesis
EVANGELION" this week, which is
a legendary Japanese anime originally
aired in 1995-1996. I found that
it chooses watchers. I think the
series consists of three parts:
the beginning (1st-4th,) the middle
(5th-23rd,) and the final (24th-26th)
I like the beginning part the most
and I recommend to everyone: it has the
essence of the whole story. The latter
you go, the stronger the originality of the
creator manifests, which I think not for all people.

Used MINI Dealer
I like the design of MINI cars.
As my wife and I are expected to
have a newborn on December, we went
to a used MINI dealer looking for our
future [redacted] car. After seeing
a few different models, we picked
a green one and got a quote.
Although we were onboard with the
purchase plan, we sought advice from
close people who have cars. My mother
told me we ought to wait until we would
have our baby on a stroller so that we would
be able to realistically imagine how we'd use the car.
